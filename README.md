# Intelligent-Fan-Air-Cooling-System
Repository for MATLAB simulink challenge project hub sustainability and renemable energy challenge under the theme of Intelligent Fan Air Cooling System
Night-time temperatures are generally lower than daytime temperatures. we are modelling a simple fan mechanism that pumps-in or extracts air based on temperature differential between inside and outside.  
The cooler night-time air can be used to bring down the temperature of air and capacitive elements within the house. Over the course of the day, the air and the cooler structure will keep temperatures lower, until it crosses the evening or night-time temperatures

                                   REAL WORLD APPLICABILITY OF THE APPROACH ADOPTED

1. A closed-loop controller receives power from the BLDC via an inverter.
2. Current passes to its windings to control the speed and torque of the control unit.
3. BLDC motors have high efficiency, with low maintenance requirements. 
4. They are more stable and long-lasting.

BLDC motor runs on low current so can run longer on solar, regular, and inverters.

SPECIFICATION OF BLDC FAN:
•	Air delivery-270
•	Input voltage-140-285
•	Frequency-48-52
•	Power factor-0.98
•	Bearing-ZZ shielded double ball bearing
•	Remote-speed control and booster mode.
